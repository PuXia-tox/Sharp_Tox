## Research Themes

### New Approach Methodologies (NAMs)
We develop omics-based and in vitro NAMs (e.g., transcriptomics, phenomics, organ-on-chip) to support next-generation chemical risk assessment.

### AOP-informed systems toxicology
We integrate transcriptomic signals with AOP networks to derive mechanistic, pathway-based evidence and quantitative points of departure.

### Cross-species hazard prediction
We compare responses across zebrafish, Daphnia, and human-relevant systems to build transferable mechanistic models.

### AI-enabled predictive toxicology
We develop data-driven and hybrid models for hazard prediction and regulatory decision support.
