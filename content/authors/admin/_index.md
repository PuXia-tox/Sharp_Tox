# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: Dr Pu Xia is an ecotoxicologist interested in understanding and predicting the molecular mechanisms underlying the toxicity of chemicals. His research focuses on the development and application of cutting-edge system toxicology approaches, including multi-omics, artificial intelligence, and adverse outcome pathway networks, to facilitate high-throughput screening and accurate prediction of chemical toxicity. Dr Pu Xia's pursuits are fundamentally oriented towards advancing the next-generation chemical risk assessment. Dr Pu Xia is a member of the Centre for Environmental Research and Justice (CERJ).
